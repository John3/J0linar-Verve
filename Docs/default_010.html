        <div class="class_method_description">
            <p> An Animation Event  will tell the reference object to start playing an animation upon  triggering. The  animation that is to be played is defined by the Event's  "AnimationData" property. If an invalid animation name is specified, no  animation will play.</p>
            <p> Animations  which play as a result of a VAnimationEvent will be adjusted so that  the correct position and timescale are applied. Animations which allow  for transitions or loop are treated no differently.</p>
            <p> While  VAnimationTrack can be added to any VSceneObjectGroup object, the  SceneObject that you intend to animate must be derived from the  'ShapeBase' class. This includes commonly used object types like  Player, Vehicle and StaticShape, but please note that TSStatic does not  derive from ShapeBase and cannot play animations.</p>
            <p> Since the ShapeBase  class networks animation thread properties, Playing or Pausing the root  Controller will affect playback on all clients.</p>

        <p class="class_method_descriptor_label">How to Use:</p>
        <div class="class_method_description">
            <p> To animate an object, you must first setup a valid VSceneObjectGroup and then create a new Track.  If you are  unsure of how to create or validate a Group, <a data-sb-indepth="true" href="default.html">click here</a>.</p>
            <p> Right-Click on the Group, go to "Add Track" and select "Add Animation Track".</p>

            <p> Right-Click on the Track and select "Add Event".</p>
            <p><img src="ShapeAnimationTrack_1.jpg" height="221" width="696"></p>
            <p> Select  the newly created Event. The Property List window will refresh and  inspect the Event. Change the "AnimationData" property to the name of  the animation you wish to have played upon triggering.</p>

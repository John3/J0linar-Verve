            <p>There are a few ways to display a sequence to your audience. The first, and probably most common method is to present a Cinematic or Cutscene event. To help with this, Verve comes with a few handy scripts and GUIs to help with this.</p>
            <p>Inside the script file, "scripts/server/VCinematicController.cs", you will find a script class for a Cinematic controller. This class will setup a GUI and relieve the user of control of their avatar until the sequence is complete. To use this class, all you need to do is call the following method:</p>
            <pre>Verve::PlayCinematic( "sequences/mySequence.vsf" );</pre>
            <p>Just replace the argument, "sequences/mySequence.vsf", with the path to the sequence file you wish to play.</p>
            <p>Not all sequences that you play will be classified as a full-blown Cinematic or Cutscene, so you'll need to know how to play your own sequence through script as well. The first thing you need to do is to create a VController object. If you haven't yet familiarised yourself with this class, now would be a good time to, but basically this is the object that controls the entire sequence.</p>
            <pre>// Create the Controller.
%controller = new VController();</pre>
            <p>Now that the controller has been created, you need to load the sequence:</p>
            <pre>// Load the Sequence.
%controller.readFile( %sequenceFile );</pre>
            <p>In case you wanted to preload a sequence at initialisation, the controller will not play the sequence until it is requested:</p>
            <pre>// Play the Sequence.
%controller.play();</pre>
            <p>You also have direct control over how the sequence plays and can stop or pause the sequence at any stage during playback:</p>
            <pre>// Pause the Sequence.
%controller.pause();

// Stop the Sequence.
%controller.stop();</pre>

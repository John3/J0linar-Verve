            <p>This group is unique - you can only have <em>one</em> Director Group in your sequence.</p>
            <p> The Director Group, coupled with a Director Track, gives you power over scene definition and camera views in your sequence. This is particularly useful for Cinematic or Cutscene sequences! You wouldn't need to use a Director if you were, say moving an elevator or opening a door. In this case, you will remain in control of your Player, Vehicle or Camera.</p>
            <p>The Director Track also allows you to define Scenes in your sequence, which can be <em>jumped</em> to using Scene Jump Events.</p>

        <p class="class_method_descriptor_label">How to Use:</p>
        <div class="class_method_description">
            <p>In this Sequence, I have a Director Group and Track as well as a valid Camera Group.  If you are  unsure of how to create or validate a Group, <a data-sb-indepth="true" href="default.html">click here</a>.</p>
            <p> Right-Click on the Track and select "Add Event".</p>
            <p><img src="DirectorTrack_0.jpg" height="221" width="696"></p>
            <p> Select the newly created Event. From the Property List window, you are  able to identify which Camera you would like to Cut to when the event  is triggered.</p>
            <p> Here you can also define the name of the Scene by applying a Label to  the Event. If you wanted to define a Scene without changing the camera,  you would need to create a new Event and reference the same Camera  Group in the last Event.</p>
